# AIMET-TEST

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the project on your local machine.

[!WARNING] I have added CORS to the backend to enable the frontend to make requests to it. You need to install the CORS package on the backend for this functionality. Alternatively, you can utilize the backend server provided in this repository.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed

### Installation and Running

1. **Backend**: Follow the instructions in the [Backend Run Guide](./technical-test-frontend-mock-server-main/README.md).
2. **Frontend**: Follow the instructions in the [Frontend Run Guide](./technical-test-frontend-main/README.md).
